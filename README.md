ORCA 3136's Robot code for FRC 2019: Deep Space

Welcome to the 2019 FRC Robot code for ORCA's robot, Stingray

This is actually not the true code to the robot, simply a sandbox area for me to test different structuring
and other programming feats. Pretty much everything in here will be untested for a while, and ill probably forget to
update this when its no longer untested so woot!


mainly meant for my team to keep up with my developments, but hey they dont read this anyways because ya know, its programming stuff and no one likes to read code and learn new stuff outside of robotics itself. (except henry, proud of you henry)


anyways, enjoy - CH
